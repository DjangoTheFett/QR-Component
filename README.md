# my first submission to frontendmentor.io

    I have tried my hand at web development in the past and I am slowly returning to it, this submission isn't perfect but is very close to the original design.

    I did not download the design folder I just used the picture and did my best to approximate the padding margins, font sizes card size etc.

    It has been some long time since I have done anything with html css or any web development so my biggest problem with this was remembering the name of css properties to properly manipulate the html components.
